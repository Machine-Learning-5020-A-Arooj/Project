Once I had this unified datetime column, I used it to create day_of_year, which took the datetime and converted it into a number between 1 and 365 that told me where that date falls in the year. I then created minutes_since_midnight by taking the hour and minute from the same datetime and converted them into a single continuous value between 0 and 1439, so the time of day is represented numerically. Finally, I used df.head() and then specifically looked at [\"Year\",\"Month\",\"Date\",\"Time\",\"day_of_year\",\"minutes_since_midnight\",\"datetime\"] with .head() to quickly check that these new columns line up correctly with the original date and time information."
